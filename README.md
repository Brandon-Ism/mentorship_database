# üéì Mentorship & Research Collaboration Matching System

A clean, web-based platform that allows students, faculty, and researchers to create academic profiles, search for others by research interest or mentorship intent, and connect for collaboration.

Built using **Flask**, **MySQL**, and **HTML/CSS**, this project was completed as part of a database design course and demonstrates a fully functional CRUD+Search system backed by a normalized relational schema.

---

## Features

- Create academic profiles with position, institution, bio, and headshot
- Select up to 5 research interests (with keyword reuse and autocomplete)
- Indicate intent: Collaboration, Providing Mentorship, Receiving Mentorship
